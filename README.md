# SDAIA-EYE
Primary symptoms of visual pollution include eye fatigue, distraction, and decreases in the diversity of opinions. In order to reduce this I propose a model which can accurately identifies this visual pollution. The dataset of the images containing 11 classes of visual pollution was provided by SDAIA gives a better support to my project.
